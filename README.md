## 📁 Folder Structure

* **`calculadora/`** → Calculator with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* **`classes/`** → Object-oriented programming exercises (e.g., `Pessoa` class).
* **`ficheiro/`** → File reading and writing exercises.
* **`imports/`** → Exercises on functions and imports between files (`soma`, `multiplicacao`, `resultado`).
* **`listas/`** → Exercises involving lists and data manipulation.
* **`penalti/`** → Interactive penalty mini-game with scoring.

## ▶️ How to Run the Exercises

1. Open the terminal in the root folder `exercicios`:

```bash
cd path/to/exercicios
```

2. Run the desired script using Python’s module option:

```bash
python -m calculadora.calculadora
python -m classes.pessoa
python -m penalti.penaltis
python -m listas.lista
```

> ℹ️ **Note:** Replace `path/to/exercicios` with the actual path on your computer.

> **Comment:** Using `python -m` ensures proper module imports. This structure also allows running exercises independently.
